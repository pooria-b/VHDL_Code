this repository is a WIP and will be updated frequently. It also contains code for signal processing usage and also digital design that I have written in VHDL.
I have started with the basics and created a Full Adder, Signed Adder, etc. after that I tried to write more complex code for signal processing usage
I will be working on protocols like I2C, especially for common  and so on.
hope you enjoy them
